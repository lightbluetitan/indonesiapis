Title: Access Indonesian Data via Public APIs and Curated Datasets
Version: 0.1.1
Maintainer: Renzo Caceres Rossi <arenzocaceresrossi@gmail.com>
Description: Provides functions to access data from public RESTful APIs including 
    'Nager.Date', 'World Bank API', and 'REST Countries API', retrieving real-time or historical 
    data related to Indonesia, such as holidays, economic indicators, and international 
    demographic and geopolitical indicators. The package also includes a curated collection of 
    open datasets focused on Indonesia, covering topics such as consumer prices, poverty 
    probability, food prices by region, tourism destinations, and minimum wage statistics. 
    The package supports reproducible research and teaching by integrating reliable 
    international APIs and structured datasets from public, academic, and government sources. 
    For more information on the APIs, see:
